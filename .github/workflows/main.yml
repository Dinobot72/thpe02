    # Your CMakeLists.txt needs Catch2, so we install libcatch2-dev

        sudo apt-get update

    # 3. Configure CMake
    # This creates the build directory and prepares the build
    - name: Configure CMake

    # 4. Build the project
    # This runs 'make' (or equivalent) inside the build directory
    - name: Build
      run: cmake --build build

    # 5. Run the tests
    # This runs 'ctest' inside the build directory, which will
    # execute your 'strtest' executable and run all Catch2 tests.
